# KonanaVision
KonanaVision is a mobile application that demonstrates the capabilities of augmented and virtual reality powered by ViroReact and React Native. The app was built over the course of a week for the final project for MIS301H. The augmented reality figure was modeled after my MIS 301H professor, Professor [Prabhudev Konana]( https://faculty.mccombs.utexas.edu/prabhudev.konana/) and says one of his catchphrases, “hypocrisy unlimited.” The virtual reality landscape is a panorama photo of UT Austin at night.
